## About
### A 2023 UC Berkeley Capstone project to mitigate racial, gender and other forms of bias in data and machine learning models

#### Aknowledgements
Our project was heavily influenced by the previous research by Depeng Xu, Shuhan Yuan, Lu Zhang, Xintao Wu from University of Arkansas,
and their published paper [FairGAN+: Achieving Fair Data Generation and Classification through Generative Adversarial Nets].

#### Model Architecture
While a lot of work is based on the FairGAN+ model one of the major enhancements to the architecture was the addition of the Attention layer, which 
broadened this GAN architecture to be applicable on more complex tabular datasets with many features.
